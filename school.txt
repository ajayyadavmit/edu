KM Foundation Education 

Core values 

Life Principles , Life Ethics and Moral Education. 

Strong Mind attitudes develop. 

>> We teach about Life. How to live in life and how to struggle.. So students are supposed to do eveyrthing in part of life activities. 

What is not Our Principles.. 
Conficts with MODERN education system.. 

1. Power and Ego 
2. Money - Economics Earnings. 

> modern educ teaches and give pressure to student , how to secure good marks, earn high money, to be in high positions by even bluffing things wrongly at some person place.... 
> We teach simply about Life, how to even live LIFE alone. How to become STRONG minded, & Calm Peace. 

Once you become strong mind, then you can achive any thing automatically (i.e. Power, Position, Money), However our education system does not encourages students to go behind. 

Our eudcaton system > encourages things to fall behind to student FOOT hills... 


> humans are born to be freedom of mind, freedom of place, activity. But Society synchronizes.. and LAW... 

So we need more Lands areas so that students play explore things in these areas... 

Kali Mata Foundation... 

we eat Meat by praying to Kali god who is Death and Destruction .. but destruction is for Goodness... 

We eat anything to Surive like a Warrriors.. Life is war zone.. So you should survive in any phase unless you want to LEAVE this BOdy by yourself...
